5. main.cpp: The main function file. This file creates two tasks on individual threads using two separate semaphores.

6. Makefile: This is the project file which contains rules that tell the system how to compile the source files and produce a working executable called barrier.

7. Doxyfile: This file contains the settings for the Doxygen tool. It is generated by the Doxygen program when run for the first time.

8. README: This is a text file which describes the project.
