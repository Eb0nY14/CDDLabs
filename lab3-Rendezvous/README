DESCRIPTION:
This file explains what this project(lab) is all about. The aim of this project is to create at least two threads which demonstrates a rendezvous in action using a common semaphore.

This project uses the following files in order to achieve its purpose:

1. Semaphore.h: Header file for the Semaphore class.

2. Semaphore.cpp: The implementation file for the Semaphore class.

3. main.cpp: The main function file. It must create at least two threads showing a rendezvous in action using a common semaphore.

4. Makefile: This is the project file which contains rules that tell the system how to compile the code and produce a working executable called rendezvous. A "clean" rule that deletes all .o files from the project should be included too. 

5. Doxyfile: This file contains the settings for the Doxygen tool. It is generated by the Doxygen program when run for the first time.

6. README: This is a text file which describes the project.
