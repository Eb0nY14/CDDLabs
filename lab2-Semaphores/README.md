## TITLE
Lab 2:Semaphores
In this lab, the main.cpp file is edited so that the two functions (taskOne and taskTwo) are run in separate threads. 
Semaphore is used to ensure that taskOne runs and exits before taskTwo.

## FILES
The files needed for this lab and what each contains are explained below:

1. Semaphore.h -> This is the header file for the Semaphore class. It contains all the function declarations and macro definition.

2. Semaphore.cpp -> This is the implementation file for the Semaphore class and contains the source code for this class.

3. main.cpp -> This file is the source code. It contains the main() function of a c++ program where the program begins execution. 
   	       For this task, the main function must create at least two threads where one thread signals the other using a common semaphore.

4. Makefile -> This is the project file. It contains rules that tell the system how to compile the code and produce a working executable
	       called signal.

5. Doxyfile -> This file contains the settings for the Doxygen tool. It is generated by the doxygen program when run for the first time.

6. README -> This is a text file that describes the project. It is a must-have for every project.
